## Activation Engine


Compares three activation modes on synthetic graphs with overlapping fiber pathways:


- **Classic**: BFS spreading activation with distance-based decay

- **Reflex**: Trail-based activation through fiber pathways only

- **Hybrid**: Reflex primary + limited classic BFS for discovery (default in v0.6.0+)


| Neurons | Fibers | Classic (ms) | Reflex (ms) | Hybrid (ms) | Classic # | Reflex # | Hybrid # | Reflex Recall | Hybrid Recall |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 100 | 10 | 1.57 | 0.02 | 0.34 | 85 | 17 | 67 | 17.6% | 76.5% |
| 500 | 50 | 3.07 | 0.03 | 0.46 | 231 | 45 | 160 | 10.0% | 59.7% |
| 1000 | 100 | 2.18 | 0.02 | 0.4 | 190 | 32 | 128 | 4.2% | 54.7% |
| 3000 | 300 | 3.06 | 0.04 | 0.44 | 242 | 61 | 174 | 2.9% | 49.6% |
| 5000 | 500 | 2.29 | 0.14 | 0.45 | 171 | 176 | 257 | 3.5% | 50.9% |


### Speedup


| Graph Size | Classic vs Hybrid | Classic vs Reflex |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 100 | 4.6x | 78.5x |
| 500 | 6.7x | 102.3x |
| 1000 | 5.5x | 109.0x |
| 3000 | 7.0x | 76.5x |
| 5000 | 5.1x | 16.4x |


**Average recall** -- Reflex only: 7.6% | Hybrid: 58.3%


## Full Pipeline

## Methodology


- **Platform**: InMemoryStorage (NetworkX), single-threaded async
- **Runs**: 10 per measurement (median reported)
- **Warmup**: 1 warmup run excluded from timing
- **Hybrid strategy**: Reflex trail activation (primary) + classic BFS with `max_hops // 2` (discovery, dampened 0.6x)
- **Seed**: `random.seed(42)` for reproducibility
